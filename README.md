### 1 - What is JavaScript and where does it live? 

JavaScript is most often used as a language that scripts the browser. As such it:

- Lives in the front end and is executed locally
- Is not compiled
- Limited by what the browser 

Where does JavaScript live? You can write JavaScript in the <script> tag within an HTML page. Or, you can write JavaScript in external files using the .js extension and link to these files with the <script src=”file.js”> tag. 

### 2 - JavaScript in Action Demo

- JavaScript basic syntax
- Using the console and console.log(). 

Example 1

### 3 - The DOM and ids

Using document.getElementById()

### 4 - Build a simple program tip calculator

### 5 - JavaScript is weird with Strings and Numbers

Concatenate strings with the +. There is only one type of number. When combining numbers and strings with + it’s all string: 2 + “2” = “22”. 

Oh yeah and there are a few weird situations with =, ==, and +. Talk more about these later. 

## Projects and Challenges

Everything gets a better reception when it looks good, style your tip calculator. Pay attention to the font styles. Think about the input field, you set the font, you can also set the border and padding (padding sets the space).
